Hachette Audio presents Strange the Dreamer, written by Laini Taylor, read by Steve West.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
For Alexandra, unique in the world.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,160
Prologue.

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:29,160
On the second sabbat of twelfth moon, in the city of Wee, a girl fell from the sky.

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,600
Her skin was blue, her blood was red.

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,680
She broke over an iron gate, crimping it on impact.

7
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:45,880
And there she hung, impossibly arched, graceful as a temple dancer swooning on a lover's arm.

8
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,080
One slick finial anchored her in place.

9
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,600
Its point, protruding from her sternum, glittered like a brooch.

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,440
She fluttered briefly as her ghost shook loose, and torched ginger buds rained out of her

11
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,360
long hair.

12
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,880
Later, they would say these had been hummingbird hearts, and not blossoms at all.

13
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,040
They would say she hadn't shed blood, but wept it.

14
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,280
That she was lewd, tonguing her teeth at them, upside down and dying.

15
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,680
That she vomited a serpent that turned to smoke when it hit the ground.

16
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,440
They would say a flock of moths came, frantic, and tried to lift her away.

17
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,440
That was true.

18
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,200
Only that.

19
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,040
They hadn't a prayer, though.

20
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,600
The moths were no bigger than the startled mouths of children.

21
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,920
And even dozens together could only pluck at the strands of her darkening hair until

22
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,360
their wings sacked, sodden with her blood.

23
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,520
They were pearled away with the blossoms as a grit-choked gust came blasting down the

24
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,080
street.

25
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,840
The earth heaved underfoot.

26
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,480
The sky spun on its axis.

27
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,200
A queer brilliance lanced through billowing smoke, and the people of Weep had to squint

28
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,080
against it.

29
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:08,400
Blowing grit and hot light, and the stink of saltpeter, there'd been an explosion.

30
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,320
They might have died, all and easily.

31
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,760
But only this girl had, shaken from some pocket of the sky.

32
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,840
Her feet were bare, her mouth stained damson.

33
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,700
Her pockets were all full of plums.

34
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,640
She was young and lovely and surprised, and dead.

35
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,200
She was also blue.

36
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,240
Blue as opals, pale blue.

37
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:41,280
Blue as cornflowers or dragonfly wings, or a spring, not summer, sky.

38
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,840
Someone screamed.

39
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,860
The scream drew others.

40
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,000
The others screamed too.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,280
Not because a girl was dead, but because the girl was blue.

42
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,520
And this meant something in the city of Weep.

43
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,200
Even after the sky stopped reeling, and the earth settled, and the last fumes spluttered

44
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,280
from the blast site and dispersed, the screams went on, feeding themselves from voice to

45
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,760
voice a virus of the air.

46
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,800
The blue girl's ghost gathered itself and perched, bereft, upon the spear-point tip

47
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,000
of the projecting finial, just an inch above her own still chest.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,160
Gasping in shock, she tilted back her invisible head and gazed, mournfully, up.

49
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,520
The screams went on and on.

50
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:36,440
And across the city, atop a monolithic wedge of seamless, mirror-smooth metal, a statue

51
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:43,440
stirred, as though awakened by the tumult, and slowly lifted its great, horned head.
